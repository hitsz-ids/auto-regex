Text for UI elements are grouped together as a set of translation keys in *_data/locale.yml*, this make TeXt easy to support different languages.

By using `titles`, you can define multi-language name for page, layout and navigator title. TeXt default defined some multi-language name in *_data/navigation*, *_layouts/archive*, *_layouts/home* and *about.md*.
